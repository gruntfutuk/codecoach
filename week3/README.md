# WEEK 3 class

Two prime topics this week, command line arguments and working with files.

Multiple scripts were written in the class to illustrate these capabilities.

Notes were provided in two disctinct pdf files, plus another pdf file for
homework. All three pdfs and my rewritten markdown versions are in the folder.

The homework was given with a pretty high level description that I found
somewhat confusing at first. It was about accepting command line arguments and
saving them to a file that extended on each run of the script so you had a
complete history of command line arguments.

I wrote two versions of the homework, and tweaked both. In both cases, a
dictionary was created to hold the command line arguments and write them to
file (using JSON to structure the information in a human readable text format).
Initially I used position on command line as the keys but sebsequently
introduced a list of named keys. The first script largley stuck to commands
covered in the classes but the second version used some other techniques
learned outside of the classroom that made the programme simpler, more
efficient and more elegent (in my humble opinion).
