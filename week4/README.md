# WEEK 4 class

Concentrated on functions and loading public data using JSON.

The script `calc.py` calls a simple function to do basic arithmetic, clearly
this is not useful as the capability is built in to Python anyway, however it
does illustrate how functions work, and clearly much more complex (and non
standard) operations could be developed to service a particular need.

I wrote a second version, `calc2.py`, that passed a function rather than a
string with an operator in it. I wrote a set of functions to cover the standard
arithmetic. There is a module already built in to Python that offers this
already for all of the arithmetical and logical operators.

The script `crime.py` loads UK Police crime data (public repository) for a
particular area, coverts that to a Dictionary using the JSON module, and prints
selected data out.


## Notes and homework to follow.
