# Variables
Starting with variables for integers and strings
Need to cast integers to strings using str() function to
join to strings.

## Lists
Lists are  defined using [] and can be changed
Tuples are defined using () and can not be changed
Dictionaries are for key pairs defined using {}.

Once Lists, Tuples or Dictionary variables are defined
then all access to their contents uses [] rather
than the brackets used to define them in the first place.

Entries in lists that references variables use
pointers rather than passing by value.
