# WEEK 1 class

File `Variables.pdf` is from the tutor, a few days after the class, and
`variables.md` is my rewrite of same for clarity for myself.

Class focused on getting people up-and-running with Python on various
laptops, with Apple MacBooks being easy (Python is already installed)
and some Widows laptops being rather a challenge.

Fortunately, both myself and my wife have MacBooks running the latest
version of macOS. I has also installed the latest versions of 2.x and
3.x Python (Apple ships an older 2.x version).

There was also a recommendation to use the Notepad++ text editor
on Windows. I prefer Vim on macOS and my wife has taken to Atom.

We wrote some simple scripts in the lesson and then additional scripts
for the homework given in the `Variables.pfd` (and my `variables.md`) file.

The scripts were focused on creating and using variables, including lists and
dictionaries.
