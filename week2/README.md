# WEEK 2 class

Focused on control structures in python,

* for loops
* if statements

Scripts in lesson helped demonstrate these concepts. The final class example
used nested for loops to check what numbers in a selected range were prime
numbers. (It didn't use the most efficient technique for this, as the point was
just to illustrate for loops.)

Homework was to print the names of the month and the number of days in each
using loops and if statements on a dictionary.

`Basic Control Flow Statements.pdf` contains notes and homework from the tutor.
The `basiccontrolflow.md` markdown file is my alernative version of the same.
