# WEEK 6 class

The next, and final scheduled class, will focus on using SQLite (introduced in
Week 5) from Python.

The sixth class was cancelled and as of 2017-04-17, no new class was scheduled.

The author of this repository left the course at this point as the original
six weeks allocated had elapsed. Any additional contribution to the respository
will be at the author's own inclination.
